The staff is extremely friendly- they know when to check in and when to just let your group hang out and enjoy the Windsor. If you re not hung up on meat  please try the burger Windsor style- it doesn t get any better for the $11 price- and includes one of their indulgent sides (mac n cheese for the win). Expect a crowd because the establishment is top notch- the owners know a thing or two about creating an  experience  as they also manage the Postino chain (one of the 3 locations is basically across the street from Windsor). If you re in the mood for a really incredible place to hang out  have a few drinks  indulge in some delicious food  and really just enjoy a laid back dining experience then the Windsor should be at the top of your  must try  list.

I almost always order the same thing--a bean and cheese burro with an extra flour tortilla--since I don t eat red meat or chicken (and because I m a creature of habit). Their cheese crisp is also amazing-basic  but delicious. Good chips and salsa (chips are pretty good-thin  but good- but the salsa is GREAT!) Yes  they do charge for them  but I suspect they would be inundated with homeless people looking for free chips and salsa otherwise  since it s not exactly in the greatest neighborhood (Sunnyslope  represent!). I ve heard their navajo tacos and green corn tamales are top-notch  as are their machaca burros  according to my (non-veggie) friends and family. Their flour tortillas rock. I m very picky about my tortillas  and these are the best I ve tried here. They re leaps and bounds above the famous Carolina s tortillas  far superior to Via Delosantos (which is just a mediocre restaurant overall  IMO)  and not even in the same category as tortillas from the chain restaurants like Manuel s or Macayo s. Their desserts are great  too  and the free cinnamon crisp-y things they give you with your bill are very tasty. Now  what I DON T like about El Bravo:1) Hours: I m a night owl. Please stay open later  EB! They close at 8 on weekdays and 8:30 on Fridays and Saturdays (I believe)  and are closed on Sundays. I would really prefer if they stayed open until at least 9 on weekdays and 9:30 on weekends-I often don t get off work until 7:30  and I work 30 minutes away  so I can never come here on days that I work  which is unfortunate. I m not asking them to turn into delux  but really-8 is waaaayyy too early to close. 2) Small parking lot. Not really their fault  but if you go on a weekend  you may have to park across the street. 3) Service. It can either be friendly and speedy (on a slow weekday night)  or friendly yet slow as molasses (on a busy weekend night). I ve gone there so much that the servers (there s only a couple of them that work there) usually remember me. Wish they had more staff so the service was better on weekends. Alas.Overall  though  I love El Bravo-simple  no-frills  and utterly delicious.</th>\n",

Even while busily trying to get people seated  she made time to to bring a small ice water outside to Charlie.While waiting for our table (about 20 min)  she offered to get us some drinks as there were only a few minutes left in Happy Hour.  And then every single employee  server manager  whoever  smiled and said Hi on their way by.  Busy as hell  and still cool.Now for the food  we got some sliders for Charlie  and Sarah and I both had the Crab Cake BLT.  We ate everything.  Happily.  Not  the best thing I ever ate   but still wonderful.  Our super-hostess came by and brought Charlie a treat from Churn next door as a thank you for being such a good girl the whole time.

       "      <th>Okay  how can you not like Texaz Grill? Bad mood? Not hungry? Vegan? Bringing a baby carrier? Then you should probably stay home. Yes  it s a dive in an aging strip mall at 16th and Bethany. Yes  there is lots of junk hanging from the ceiling and walls that a few won t appreciate as low-brow Texas ambiance. And yes  the portions tend to be on the  enormous  side so if you re watching your waistline  plan on splitting a meal. But rest assured the place is a Phoenix icon and will be  til way after you re gone. It is texas-style comfort food - nice and simple. The steaks are great - they cut and age their own like a real steakhouse. The prime rib  when you arrive early enough  is superb - and shockingly cheap considering the cut. And I doubt you d find a better  more authentic texas-style chicken fried steak (and chicken fried chicken) anywhere in town. So big you ll want to share - or take 1/2 home. But is is goooood.If you re a newbie to Texas Grill - it s good to know that probably 90% of the clientele are regulars and are likely close personal friends to the staff of many years. This tip is helpful so that you don t get lynched by the surrounding tables for dissing the busy waitress because your water glass gets low. Come to Texaz in a good mood and ready to eat and you ll be fine. In time the staff may take a cotton to you too - but you ll have to earn it.There s not a mistake on the menu. One great value is to order the chop steak as a burger (it s not on the menu) and you ll have one of the best burgers in town. If you re a party of one or there s a few open seats - belly up to the bar. Tammy and Cindy are the usual evening bartenders and they serve one of the best margaritas in town - on the rocks (only) and with salt of course. The selection at the bar is simple and basic  but you ll be entertained all night trying to read decades of bumper stickers and fridge magnets. You may even meet a few new friends as the regulars are a friendly bunch (especially after a marg or two).When visitors come to town  you can bet Texaz is always in the mix. Sure we hit Scottsdale for glam  downtown for urban cool  and Barrio or Richardsons for nuevo mexican - but for a fun evening with friends plus good comfort food  you can t beat Texaz.  Watch for us at the bar!</th>\n",

We ve never had nasty food at Fuddruckers so we decided to stop in here and split a big burger. We ordered the number 2. It s a huge burger 2/3 pounder  with fries and an endless refill of drinks. We also ordered a side of onion rings. I didn t see the dirtiness others have suggested in previous reviews listed. The restaurant is covered with memorabilia from old rock artist  we decided to sit near the Elvis corner of the building. They do have 3 or four booths in the corners but all were filled so we parked at a table and got our first of a few sodas. Right in front of us was a flat screen TV with football on.. Oh yeah  this was a nice casual atmosphere  burger  fries  football what else can you ask for. The place was pretty slow for a holiday around lunchtime  but I was OK with that. I mean I don t mind getting my food faster. We waited about 15 minutes and split our food up and put all the toppings we prefer on our huge burger. Yumms  it was good. Nice and juicy perfect size to split into two. I was happy by coming here  you always know what to expect. The buns are nice and fresh and the selection of toppings is wonderful. The only thing that bugged me was the onion rings were really greasy  so I put mine to the side. Also they must have had a district manager and manager present that afternoon  cause we kept getting starred at by people dressed in suits walking around. As soon as we were done with eating we had our plates picked up  and we hung out watching the end of the game for another 15 min or so. Thumbs up for me  I left happy and stuffed.</th>\n",

The service is fantastic. Especially this one gentlemen that works there  that always seems to be wearing a bow-tie. He is friendly and funny  and I get excited whenever we are seated in his section. With that said  I don t want to take away from the other people that work there  because they are all awesome too. I am yet to have a sub-par experience with the staff.They start you off with complimentary hot tea and water. It s good tea too. It s unsweetened  but if you are like my boyfriend and need it sweet  there is sugar available of course. However  I like it as is.The food itself is wonderful. The first time I went  I had a spicy shrimp dish  served with steamed white rice. It had the perfect amount of kick  and there was just enough to fill me up and and then some to take home to enjoy later. My personal favorite dish though is the beef and broccoli. Definitely a classic  but the broccoli is always the perfect texture  and the sauce is so rich and the beef is always great  for this dish. Usually we get the dinner combination that comes with a bowl of soup (also good)  a crab puff  a chicken wing  and an egg roll. I usually trade my boyfriend the eggroll for the chicken wing  because they are each of our favorites. This place is great for a weeknight dinner out.....

The noodle dishes here are eight or nine dollars and have huge portions.

The Korean spicy noodle bowl also outdid itself with sliced beef strips and a wonderfully hot hot hot taste.

All the sudden that $30 bottle of pinot looked pretty damn good.  So for $15 we had four glasses of wine on the cheap.  The owners know the one way to my heart -- wine specials!!  Yes  it s official.  I m easy.When I got the tab did I realize that dinner here (with the wine) was CHEAPER than breakfast earlier that day at Orange Table.

The window coverings  adobe booths  throw pillows  copper bar top  teal awnings  eclectic mix of soft rock  and even the prickly pear margiratas. The feel and atmosphere are almost the same. They even serve meals on big metal plates  often times with tortillas under them. Anyone who thinks this place is original needs to go see Richardson immediately.All that aside  the food here is really good. I ordered the Carne Adovada which came a little drier than what I m used to a Rich s place  which was a welcome change as they really let the pecan wood smoked pork speak for itself. The tortilla accompanying the dish was not tearable  but rather so dried out that it broke when I tried to tear it. This was the only dissappointment of the dish. Beans and rice were identical to Richardson s  smokey and delicious. The girlfriend ordered the Enchiladas  which to her surprise were the Red  White  and Blue Enchiladas from Richardsons. One chicken  one shrimp  and one cheese  wrapped in different colored tortillas smothered in green sauce. They were very much exactly what we were used to.All in all  I d say that Barbara  the owner  probably is using the same recipes and has obviously used the same formula here.

You can wash that one down with a tamarind soda or horchata if you like.My tip for fellow yelpers east of the Mississippi river  where good masa is hard to find  go ahead and order a dozen tamales packed cold for your carry on bag--even a five hour flight gets them into the freezer to stay great tasting for months.My fellow travelers have taken on the burritos and tostadas  with positive remarks.  Tortillas are genuine--hard to ruin a bean/cheese otherwise. Again  this is not the best Mexican you ll ever eat  but it is the best you ll ever eat in an airport--so that s how I justify the five stars here.</th>\n",

And  yes  there s forty million sodas to choose from but if you re looking for  diet   you ll be forced to choose pepsi.Still: four stars because the bread is awesome! I can not wait to go back and get a sandwich! Chewy  but you re not going to break your jaw or cut the roof of your mouth on it. And  the rocket sauce puts other  secret sauces  to shame!Bottom line: don t forget the  subs  at Rocket Burger!</th>\n",

       "      <th>I went to the Phoenix Hard Rock Cafe for lunch on a Friday. It wasn t very busy  so I figured I would sit at the bar. The two servers/bartenders were super nice and friendly. So was management that I spoke with so I have nothing negative to say about the service. It was quick and friendly. But the menu! It sucks! It is way overpriced! And nothing I had was good. For $10 I got the worst plate of nachos I have ever had! Sure it was big and plenty to share and even more to throw out  but it was awful. Glad I didn t pay another $4 for meat because it was so bad that even meat could not improve it! The beans had no flavor  the jalapeno provided the only bit of flavor to the plate. The salsa was pure trash- more live crushed tomatoes and no flavor! You would think in the SW they could at least adapt and go with a better salsa! My other pick was potato skins  I love the things. The guy next to me ordered them  $9 for a half plate of the tiny-est potatoes I think anyone could skin! I think there were 6 halves but certainly not more than 8 halves  all the size of a child s palm! I had a frozen drink called a Pickled Tink $6.75. Awful! Did not come completely mixed and barely pink. Tasted overwhelmingly of the coconut flavor. It was frozen and slushy and weak enough to feed to a kid. If I had one with me I would have let him/her have it  seriously. It was my birthday as was maybe 4 other unfortunate souls to be eating there. They gave us each a Sundae with fudge on the whip cream and a small candle. They shouted at the patrons to to shoot Happy Birthday at each of us at separate times and clap. It was pretty weak by the third attempt to get participation. It was nice of my servers to surprise and acknowledge me. Though I was not looking for any handout or commotion. I had a few bites of the sundae and it was even awful! The ice cream was full of ice crystals! So over all I will have to disagree with others and say Applebee s food is much  much better and not as expensive! To Applebee s I ll return but to the HRC  this is my last visit. Years ago I went to the Phoenix HRC when it was on Camelback  if I remember the street correctly. The building &amp; bar was more impressive as was the decor and so was the food. I went on a birthday then too  I wonder why they moved to this location? The entry is nothing eye catching or grand as it was then. In fact if the Light Rail driver had not announced it i would not have seen it as I had not seen it on previous trips to and pass the area. Before this stop at the HRC  I had been a fan of the place for years. Had once spent many evenings at the Boston HRC when I lived in MA and had fond memories of the old Phoenix location as well. But just as the music we call Rock has deteriorated so has this conglomeration! So long fair well HRC  I withdraw my support of you.</th>\n",

Lots of people drinking  eating chips and salsa  etc. (though not as many as past visits...the economy?). We had no trouble getting a nice table out in the patio area  so we could watch an Italian sports staple being played in a Mexican restaurant:)The people watching at Aunt Chilada s is wonderful..all walks of life  all shapes and sizes...all getting their drink on with cheap margarita s and cheaper cerveza:) It s a tried and true formula for the transition from drone infested  uptight (I know  a word right out of the 60 s) work-a-day world to a somewhat more relaxed  slightly (or heavily) inebriated night-time world. So much fun to watch...esp. the guy with a six pack of margarita s under his belt  trying to bowl the bocce s. It would be pretty tough to generate a bocce injury  but I think he managed it:)The service was a pretty good...we never had to wait too long for refills and they kept the chips and salsa coming ( the flour tortilla chips are one of the best parts of Aunt Chilada s:)Carin had a serviceable chicken chimichanga  and I had something called a tortillion (which  interestingly enough is numeral based nomenclature for this dish  reflecting the number of calories per serving)...shredded beef  cheese  beans  tomatoes  bacon (bacon!!!!)  wrapped in a giant tortilla  dipped in egg batter and deep-fried...it sounded better than it was  but I ate about  1/2 and brought the rest home (might still be in the fridge  growling at me...not sure..afraid to look:)Nope  it s not the best Mexican restaurant in town  and it s not the best bocce court you ll ever see  but combined  they make Aunt Chilada s a decent place to have a bite and a cocktail  and to play the games that people play:)</th>\n",

The portions are gigantic but if the foods not very good it s hard to make a dent in your plate.

The sangria was perfectly sweet and winey at the same time - filled with fruit and so easy to drink I had to drink 2 cups before I realized I was kind of tipsy. They also offer 3 other sangria flavors but the waiter recommended the passionfruit.In conclusion  I would solely recommend this place for drinks and snacks.

It is a tapas only  we ordered 6 tapas between two of us just to feel satisfied. The cheapest tapas on their menu are about 4 or 5 bucks  but there s only 2 or 3 things that are that cheap  and I think they were mostly the vegetarian tapas. Most of the tapas seemed to average out at about 7 bucks. So with sake and tip  you probably average out at about $40 a person. I would definitely suggest getting a side of rice to help fill your belly.They did an awesome job of atmosphere in the restaurant  and Johnny Chu came out several times to make sure we were enjoying our food. They also had a D.J. who did a great job of choosing GOOD music to play while we ate.  I m just not sure that the timing was right for them  not very many people in downtown are quite ready for a place like this on a regular basis.

       "      <th>How many Uzbeki Jewish restaurants have you been to recently? Yeah  I thought so. Well  if you re ever curious  here s your chance  right here in Phoenix.Samarkand is in a nondescript strip mall (isn t this how I describe every other restaurant in Phoenix?) on 19th Ave just south of Northern. Curious about this joint the countless times I ve driven by it  I finally decided to head there for lunch one day.The family that runs the place is speaking in Russian in the back and all of a sudden stops and looks at me. No other customer is in here besides myself  which is fine. The wife comes forwards  greets me warmly  and hands me the menu. I survey the surroundings. Photos of the blue domed mosques that Samarkand is famous for. A disco ball hanging from the ceiling  because sometimes you just have to put down your peroshki and party. A television set is on  tuned into (from what I can tell) the Russian equivalent of the Home Shopping Network. At this current moment  Svetlana is hawking a cyclonic vacuum cleaner. I try my best to make sense of the Cyrillic captions  but I give up. And then there  on the far wall  a grand painting of Moses parting the Red Sea. It all comes together.The wife comes back. I ask her that I want to try traditional Uzbeki food. She looks at me as if I have a learning disability  but in a motherly way.  It is all traditional food.  Yeah  ok. I knew that.I haven t had borscht in ages  so I order a bowl of it. I also order a lipioshka  which is traditional Uzbek bread. It looks like a giant danish in a way: it s round  with a thick fluffy outer ring and and thinner center  sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. And to round out the meal  a couple skewers of marinated beef sheesh kebabs.While my hostess goes back to the kitchen  I play Mystery Science Theater 3000 with the Russian soap opera which has just begun. I get into it.Sergei:  Natasha  I knew you were lying the moment you said you were going to go to the Gorky Park concert. Because  really  who goes to a Gorky Park concert in 2007 Moscow? They only play  Bang! Bang!  in gypsy carnivals in Vladivostok.  Natasha:  Nyet  Sergei. I did go to the Gorky Park concert. In front of the Red Square McDonalds. I am the president of their fan club. We have 3 members. But Sergei  my name is not Natasha. I m Ludmilla. Who is this Natasha? TELL ME  WHO IS THIS NATASHA?! Answer me!  *slap*Before I get too carried off in my head  the food arrives. The borscht is a lot more brothy than I was expecting. Don t get me wrong  it s still good  but I was expecting a thick  deep purple soup. I ll chalk that up to mostly eating Russian food cooked by Russian friends of mine. The soup still has ample shreds of beets and carrots though. And even though sour cream and I aren t the best of friends these days  I would have taken one for the team and put some in my soup to bring out the flavor. But there was no sour cream brought to my table.However  the bread  this lipioshka  was awesome. The various tastes and textures between the outer ring and the center was great  and perfect for dunking a bit of it into my soup. I could have ordered a few of these and that could have been my entire lunch  no complaints.About 10 minutes later  the skewers arrived. Very unadorned - they were exactly as advertised: two skewers of beef. And that s it. I was expecting great things  but somehow I was a little underwhelmed. The beef tasted a little gamy to me  but maybe it s how it should be and I haven t acquired the taste yet. I don t know. On the plus side  it was really juicy and cooked just right.All in all  though  I d say it was worth the trip. The lipioshka alone merits a few more visits. Service is friendly  and I m guessing the main crowd comes in for dinner and subsequent partying under the disco ball  because I was the only customer they had at lunchtime. Which is a good thing  I guess  because A) you have their undivided attention and B) when you don t  you have Sergei and Ludmilla (not Natasha) to entertain you. 3 stars. May increase with future trips.</th>\n",

       "      <th>I really wanted to love this place. I had initially seen this place on groupon then read reviews and the menu and was excited to try it. Its a type of atmosphere I like in a restaurant  very modern  and nicely appointed. This ended up being one of the worst dining experiences I have had in a long time. I m generally pretty easy to please and very forgiving of little issues of a restaurant. This place missed on just about every aspect.We went at about 4:30 for a late lunch and happy hour. We sat in the lounge and greeted fairly promptly. Drink orders were taken. A little stingy on the pours of their wine. The Sangria  both red and white were tasty. The red Sangria had quite the kick. That was the best part of the evening. After asking for one more minute to browse the menu before ordering our server vanished. It was nearly 20 minutes before having to step up to the bar to ask to order food. We ordered a mix of items as I love to try lots of items from a new place. We ordered the burger  2 different tacos  crab croquettes  and the meatballs. Most of which are small plate items. The tacos are very small and do not come on a white corn tortilla. I m not quite sure what it was. I was not a fan. I hardly noticed that their was shrimp in the one taco. I only noticed from looking  it was not from tasting it. The skirt steak in the second taco was tender and flavorful. The crab croquettes and typical of bar food. You could taste the crab  not in a sweet Maryland style crab cake kind of way. It was more like a tuna fish casserole sort of taste. The burger was decent  but definitely not worthy of a $12 price tag. I have had larger Wagyu beef hamburgers for the same price that tasted so much better. The fries with the burger are good and the house made ketchup is great. The last item of what we ordered was the meatballs. Its a cute presentation with triangles of toast for dipping in the bland sauce. Unfortunately the meatballs were uncooked in the center. Not just undercooked and pink  they were RAW on the inside. I sent the dish back of course. The waitress was very apologetic and took them off the bill. As she was trying to clear the table she dropped some silverware and food at our feet. By this time she obviously was not having a good day. She brought us a complimentary dessert of a pumpkin cupcake with ice cream. The ice cream was great. The cupcake was overcooked and dry. When the bill arrived I gave my groupon and credit card to the server. The manager came back with both and apologized for bad experience and comped the whole bill. I m not sure if I would try them again. The problems with the meal were very basic things that just should never happen at a restaurant of this level.</th>\n",

First of all  they do not list any prices for beers.... I think they should probably do that considering how ridiculously expensive their beer is. We asked the server for prices and she said  They start around 4$ and then go up from there depending on the beer with an average of around 6$  Well... that s not really so helpful. I ordered the rose gaarden which is hoegaarden mixed with framboise lambic... it was good  until I found out it was almost 9$..... for a beer? What? That is the most expensive beer I have ever had. Our food was alright  but also ridiculously priced. I got the summer salad (strawberries  avocado  romaine  mandarin oranges from a can and balsamic). It was fine  but pretty small for a 9$ appetizer salad. Oh and if you want chicken on it  it s an extra 5$ or so.... that must be some amazing chicken. You can t get an entree salad or sandwich for less than 10$. I did get a cup clam chowder too  and it was not great and kind of luke warm when I got it... meh. Everyone else got sandwiches and said they were fine  but nothing special. I feel like just because the place has a lot of beers on tap does not mean they should charge double what anywhere else sells the same beers for. So anyway  for a sandwich  a salad  and 5 beers  our bill came out to about 65$. That will never ever happen again. I could go to a nice local non-chain restaurant in the valley and get better food for that kind of money  which is what I suggest everyone does.</th>\n",

       "      <th>With the exception of very friendly employees  Cafe Zupas fails in pretty much every category I can think of.  It s the cheap Paradise Bakery.  If you ve read any of my Paradise Bakery reviews  you d know that s not a compliment by any means.  Whomever dreamed up the concept of this quick service restaurant really didn t think things through.The counter is a complete cluster.  There s monitors with videos playing that blocks the menu board.  So if you don t know what you want  you need to grab a paper menu.  Pretty awkward for a first timer.  Standing in a big group of people steering at menus also was an unexpected and uncomfortable experience.   I then ordered my sandwich and a salad at the left end of the counter  navigated my way around the people waiting for soups  past the dessert counter (desserts actually looked awesome  so I d bet they were not made on sight)  then to the registers.  Retold the order I just made but was still waiting on to the cashier.  Then I had a brief wait for my food at the register.  I usually am not a big fan of the take a number system.  But that would be very helpful at this place.  Also  some sort of a ticket to hand the cashier or a register at the same place you order would be nice as well.The food wasn t very good.  The summer chicken salad was short on toppings.  Plenty of lettuce  a decent amount of fruit  but only a few pieces of chicken. The french bread from any nearby supermarket would have been tastier than what they offered on the side.  The chicken pesto panini wasn t very flavorful or filling.  While the entrees are cheap  you re going to have to shell out for the sides if you want a complete meal.There are so many fast food options in the district of Desert Ridge Marketplace.  I suggest skipping Cafe Zupa.  The short walk to Paradise Bakery is worth it if you want a quick sandwich or salad.  (Did I really just say that?)</th>\n",

Panda may not have a happy hour  but with prices like that it seems like it would be happy all the time! As if that wasn t enough reason to get you there  the food is pretty good. At first I thought maybe they just got all their customers drunk so the food didn t matter . . . luckily  this is not the case. Panda does not use MSG and has brown rice as an option. Include the fact this place is within walking distance from my house and I am even convincing myself more and more that I need to go there more often  not just all of you. The few times I have been  there have only been a few other people in the restaurant so the wait staff is ready and waiting to fulfill your every request. The few times we sat at the bar  the bartender has been very friendly  yet knew when to give us our space as well. Seeing as how there are a total of six seats at the bar  that is a good skill to have. The restaurant is a little small and there isn t much to say about the (lack of) atmosphere. All of that is the reason I am a little leery to give four stars  but right now they are at 3.5 ish. Advertisement boasts  We serve Dim Sum! Made to Order.  I haven t tried it  but now that I know it is an option  I ll have to add that to the to-do list for my next visit.</th>\n",

We waited over an hour and there was little space available  but being able to buy margaritas at the bar made it all more tolerable.The drink menu is excellent and fairly priced.  The guacamole  which is made at the table  is incredible.  I ve never had guac with pomegranate seeds  but it was a perfect mix  as it added a bit of sweetness.  My only recommendation is to not have the cheese added.  It adds a weird flavor and consistency  but not enough to ruin the guacamole  just a little strange.I had the Enchiladas de Hongos  which were quite tasty  however the sauce was sooooo thick and heavy that it somewhat overshadowed the food it covered.  Again  not enough to make it inedible  but just overpowering and detracted a bit from enjoying the rest of the flavors of the dish.Didn t get a chance to get dessert  but maybe next time.  I would definitely give this another try.</th>\n",

Wednesdays mean $1.99 margaritas  so I was pleased to enjoy one! My friend had two tacos and seemed to enjoy them with her sangria.Service was decent  though the waiter confessed he was not all that familiar with the menu.

       "      <th>AJ s has become one of my Sunday lunch favorites. I like going there because I can control the ingredients in my food. I have never had a bad meal there. The vegetables always appear fresh  and if you know how to pack your bowl then you can always get your money s worth. Even though I do enjoy my meals at AJ s there are some things that I think they can improve on. First  they only have three recipes posted on the buffet line. Other Mongolian BBQ places have at least a dozen recipes. I prefer a greater variety. Next  I really wish that they would monitor the buffet better. On one visit there was a family with many children. The parents couldn t possibly watch all of their kids. One of the youngest was picking up carrots with her hands and putting in in the bowl. When she realized that she had put too many in her bowl  she put them back on the buffet with her hands. There were no employees around anywhere. I went to the cash register to tell the girl about it  and she didn t seem very concerned. In fact she seemed bothered that I would complain. When I insisted that this was not very hygienic  she finally relented and replaced the carrots. They really need to monitor the buffet  and especially at high traffic times. They need to institute a policy requiring parents to assist young children.I also wish that they would bus the tables more quickly. I went there last night  and there were tables that were not cleared the entire time that I was there. I noticed that there were only two employees working  but the lady working at the cash register seemed to be more interested in baby sitting her child  than clearing tables or monitoring the buffet. It seemed to be a slow night  and I really can t think of a reason why she couldn t have bused the tables as well. Lastly  the decor of the restaurant is a little off putting. The first time I went there I was inclined to turn around and go somewhere else. If I had not been there with friends  I probably would have gone elsewhere. I only stayed because they swore that food was really good. I am glad I decided to stay.</th>\n",

So when I got the bill  I was charged $21.25  and not $20 (this is not including tax)  so I was thinking  wait the special is advertised for $20  NOT $21.25!  The server informed me that I was charged an  extra  $1.25 because I asked for onions on my burger! WTH!??  Are you serious??  The server never said that I would be charged extra for onions - so be careful when you order here  because Zin likes to add deceptive charges - what a Sin Zin!  Shysters.I reluctantly give 3 stars because the burger was good and the service was also pretty good.

       "      <th>Fun restaurant for a night out with friends.  The indoor and patio seating options makes it inviting for everyone from the date night to the celebration party.  The pitchers of sangria were tasty and definitely encouraged people to indulge.  The guac and salsa app was awesome with a simply prepared guac  fire roasted salsa  and fresh tortilla chips.  I had the fried chicken dinner and was less than enthused.  The chicken pieces were only partially breaded and fried.  After a few sangrias  I decided to enjoy my guilty pleasure... and there was barely any fried chicken skin!  Sadness.  It should have been called a breaded chicken because it was definitely not a fried chicken!  Ok... soapbox aside... my friend had the rotisserie prime rib and it was jam packed with flavor without the heavy salt crust.  Definitely something different to try.</th>\n",
